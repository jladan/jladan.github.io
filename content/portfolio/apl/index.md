The Advanced Undergraduate Physics Lab is the final requisite lab course for
Physics students at the University of Toronto.

I worked as a Lab demonstrator for 4 years, followed by a final year as an
Instructor, and was hired as a course developer during the summer.

- Primary maintainer of all Python software  used by the students for data
  acquisition, management, and analysis.
- Converted all lab guides from MS Word to LaTeX to standardize the format, and
  facilitate future revisions.

    - Created a custom document class for lab guides.
    - Collected all references into bibliographies.

- Improved documentation of all Python scripts and modules
- Implemented git version control for all packages, hosted on the department's
  [GitLab server](https://gitlab.physics.utoronto.ca/advanced-lab "GitLab APL group").
