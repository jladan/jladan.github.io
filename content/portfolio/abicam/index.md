I was hired as a Python and computational math tutor by a fellow Ph.D. student
to help him implement a simulation of an "Activity-Based Indoor Contaminant
Assessment Model" (ABICAM). The model tracked the exposure of semivolatile organic
compounds (SVOCs) for humans inside a workplace or home environment throughout a
day, while the occupants performed various activities. 

This was a novel approach, because nearly all previous models for chemical
exposure were based upon the steady-state solution of an inactive person. Using
this simulation, Jacob gained insights into:

- time to reach the steady-state exposure;
- effects of aerosols "scrubbing" SVOCs from the air;
- the significance of methods to reduce exposure, such as cleaning,
  changing protective equipment, and ventilation; and
- propogation of SVOCs from and through clothing.
