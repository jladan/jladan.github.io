<!-- TODO collect a list of Jacob's papers -->

I was hired as a Python and computational math tutor by a fellow Ph.D. student
to help him implement a simulation of an "Activity-Based Indoor Contaminant
Assessment Model" (ABICAM). The model tracked the exposure of volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) for humans inside a workplace or home environment throughout a
day, while the occupants performed various activities. 

This was a novel approach, because nearly all previous models for chemical
exposure were based upon the steady-state solution of an inactive person.

- Multiple papers published on the result
- Novel insights
    - time to reach the steady-state exposure
    - effects of aerosols "scrubbing" VOCs from the air
    - the significance of methods to reduce exposure, such as cleaning,
      changing protective equipment, and ventilation.
