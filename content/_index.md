Hey,

Welcome to my personal website! I'm John Ladan, a physicist and
applied mathematician with a passion for problem-solving and
innovation. With a Ph.D. in Physics and a Master's in Applied Mathematics, I bring
a unique blend of analytical rigor and creative thinking to every project I
tackle.

I'm naturally drawn to data science, web development, and scientific computing.
This website is a curated showcase of my diverse skills and experiences. You'll
find a range of [projects](/portfolio "Portfolio") that highlight my expertise
in areas like data analysis, web development, and backend engineering. My
commitment to excellence and a penchant for learning drive me to take on new
challenges.
<!-- TODO make sure this list is accurate -->

As a seasoned scientist,
I've designed and executed experiments that have expanded our [understanding of
the physical world](/portfolio/thesis/ "Icicle Research").
Additionally, I'm deeply committed to education and have had the privilege of
instructing the [4th year advanced undergraduate physics lab](/portfolio/apl/ "Teaching Physics Lab") -- a requisite
course for Physics majors at the University of Toronto.
I was also in charge of maintaining and developing the custom software students used
for data acquisiton and analysis. 
<!-- *[emphasize the importance of the lab teaching, and significance of being an instructor as a Ph.D. student]* -->

Another project I was quite proud to play a part in is the [Activity-Based Indoor
Contaminant Assessment Model (ABICAM)](/portfolio/abicam/ "Indoor Environment
Simulation"). For this, I tutored a fellow Ph.D.
student, who had limited experience with Python and scientific computing, to the
point of having a novel, time-varying model of human exposure to chemical
pollutants in workplace environments. His model was the foundation of several
academic papers on the subject.

Thank you for visiting my corner of the internet. I'm always eager to connect
with fellow enthusiasts and future collaborators. Please don't
hesitate to reach out â€“ let's embark on exciting ventures together!
