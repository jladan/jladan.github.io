Hey,

Welcome to my personal website! I'm John Ladan, a physicist and
applied mathematician with a passion for problem-solving and
innovation. With a Ph.D. in Physics and a Master's in Applied Mathematics, I bring
a unique blend of analytical rigor and creative thinking to every project I
tackle.

I'm naturally drawn to
data science, web development, and scientific computing. 
This website is a curated showcase of my diverse skills and experiences. You'll
find a range of projects that highlight my expertise in areas like 
data analysis, web development, and backend engineering. <!-- TODO make sure this list is accurate -->
My commitment to excellence
and a penchant for learning drive me to take on new challenges.


As a seasoned scientist,
I've designed and executed experiments that have expanded our understanding of
the physical world. <!-- TODO link to thesis here, i guess --> 
Additionally, I'm deeply committed to education and have had the privilege of
instructing the 4th year advanced undergraduate physics lab -- a requisite
course for Physics majors at the University of Toronto. <!-- *[emphasize the importance of the lab teaching, and significance of being an instructor as a Ph.D. student]* -->
I was also in charge of maintaining and developing the custom software students used
for data acquisiton and analysis. <!-- TODO Link to the page about the APL work -->

Another project I was quite proud to play a part in is the Activity-Based Indoor
Contaminant Assessment Model (ABICAM). For this, I tutored a fellow Ph.D.
student, who had limited experience with Python and scientific computing, to the
point of having a novel, time-varying model of human exposure to chemical
pollutants in workplace environments. His model was the foundation of several
academic papers on the subject.

<!-- TODO rewrite this  paragraph -->
When I'm not immersed in coding or crunching numbers, you can find me seeking
inspiration from the world around us, whether it's through hiking in nature or
exploring the latest advancements in technology.
<!-- Be more accurate about my interests, motorcycling, camping, programming,
woodworking, paddleboarding, stuff -->
<!-- Be more human, and relateable -->

Thank you for visiting my corner of the internet. I'm always eager to connect
with fellow enthusiasts and future collaborators. Please don't
hesitate to reach out â€“ let's embark on exciting ventures together!
